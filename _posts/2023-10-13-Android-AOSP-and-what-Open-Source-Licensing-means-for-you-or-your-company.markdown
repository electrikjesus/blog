# Android, AOSP, and what Open-Source Licensing means for you or your company

Android is one of the most popular operating systems in the world, powering billions of devices. It is based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), which is a free and open-source software platform. AOSP is important because it allows anyone to modify and redistribute the software, which has led to a wide variety of Android devices and applications.

One of the key features of AOSP is that it is using open-source software (OSS) components licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), LGPL, MIT, BSD or Apache License. Some of these licenses require that the source code for any software that is based on AOSP must also be released under the same license. This ensures that users can inspect the source code for security vulnerabilities and make changes to the software to meet their specific needs.

In this post, we will discuss the importance of following through with the GPL source requirements for AOSP. We will also provide some tips on how to evaluate the security of software that is based on AOSP.


# The Importance of Releasing Changes to the Source for AOSP

There are several reasons why it is important to follow through with the GPL source requirements for AOSP. 

First, it ensures that you are complying with the licenses of all of the open source software that you use in your product. When others can trust that you are releasing any updates made, your product image is improved and you build further confidence with your user base.

Second, it helps to ensure the security of the software. When the source code is available, anyone can inspect it for potential security vulnerabilities. This can help to prevent malicious actors from exploiting these vulnerabilities to attack users.

Third, releasing the source code can help to improve the quality of the software. When users are able to contribute to the development of the software, they can identify and fix bugs that the original developers may have missed. This can lead to a more stable and reliable software.

Fourth, releasing the source code in its entirety can help to promote innovation. When developers are able to build on the work of others, they can create new and innovative software applications. This can lead to a more vibrant and dynamic software ecosystem.


# What You Should Look For When Projects Do Not Produce Source That You Can Inspect

When an AOSP based project does not produce source code that anyone but them can look through, it is important to be wary. There are several reasons why a company might choose to do this, and we will touch upon the nefarious reasons first.



* They may be hiding something malicious. If a company is not willing to release the source code for their software, it is possible that they are hiding something malicious. This could include malware, backdoors, or other security vulnerabilities.
* They may be trying to lock you in. If a company does not release the source code, they can control how you use their software. This could mean that you are not able to make changes to the software, or that you are required to use their proprietary services.
* They may be trying to make a quick buck. Some companies will release closed-source software that is simply a repackaging of open-source software. This allows them to charge a premium for software that is actually free or was not properly licensed for commercial use.

If you are considering using an AOSP based OS solution from a company that does not release the source code, it is important to do your research. Make sure to read reviews and security reports before making a decision. You should also be prepared to pay a premium for the software, as there is no guarantee that it is safe or secure.

If you are looking for an Android project that you can be confident in, it is important to choose a project that publishes its source code. This will help to ensure that the project is secure and that it is committed to quality.


# What Can Make This Easier?

The importance of releasing source code based on AOSP cannot be overstated. AOSP is a cornerstone of the Android ecosystem, and it allows anyone to create and distribute their own version of Android. This freedom has led to a wide range of innovation, from custom ROMs to new devices and operating systems.

However, with this freedom comes responsibility. When you release a product based on AOSP, you are legally obligated to comply with the licenses of all of the open source software that you use. This can be a complex and challenging task, especially if you are not familiar with open source licensing.

Releasing source code based on AOSP is important for a number of reasons:



* Compliance: It ensures that you are complying with the licenses of all of the open source software that you use in your product.
* Transparency: It allows the community to see how you have used AOSP and other open source software, which can help to build trust and encourage collaboration.
* Security: It can help to improve the security of your product by allowing others to review your code and identify and fix vulnerabilities more quickly.
* Innovation: It can foster innovation by making it easy for others to build on your work and create new and innovative products and services.

Android-Generic Project Manager's [Auto OSS License Documentation](https://github.com/android-generic/agpm-auto-oss-license-documentation) tool can help you to comply with the licenses of all of the open source software that you use in your AOSP-based product. This tool can automatically scan your repo based code for OSS licenses and generate a manifest that documents the licenses and any required actions. This tool can be a valuable asset for any company that is releasing AOSP-based products.

In short, releasing source code based on AOSP is a good thing for everyone involved. It helps to ensure compliance, transparency, security, and innovation.


# Conclusion

In this post, we have discussed the importance of following GPL source requirements for AOSP. We have also provided some tips on how to evaluate the security of software that is based on AOSP as well as provided a solution to assist in properly maintaining projects based on open-source code..

When choosing an Android project, it is important to take a hard look at the project's security practices. One of the most important things to consider is whether or not the project publishes its source code.

If you are considering using an Android project that does not publish its source code, it is important to be aware of the risks. There is no way to know for sure whether or not the project is secure if the source code is not available. It is also important to be aware that the project may not be committed to security if they are not willing to publish the source code.

If you are looking for an Android project that you can be confident in, it is important to choose a project that publishes its source code. This will help to ensure that the project is secure and that it is committed to quality.

Here are some additional tips to help you evaluate the security of an Android project:



* Make sure the project is licensed under the GPL, LGPL, BSD, MIT or Apache. This will ensure that the source code is available for inspection.
* Read reviews and security reports. This can help you to assess the quality and security of the software.
* Be skeptical of claims of security without proof. If a company claims that their software is secure, but they do not provide any proof, it is important to be skeptical.
* Ask for a security assessment from a third-party security firm. This can help you to get an independent opinion on the security of the software.

By following these tips, you can help to ensure that you are using safe and secure Android software.
